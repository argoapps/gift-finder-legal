  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 24, 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Gift Finder ("the Mini"), a Shop Minis experience owned and operated by Argo Apps. By accessing or using the Mini, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Gift Finder is a mobile-only Shop Mini that helps users discover personalized gift ideas. The Mini:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collects questionnaire inputs about the gift recipient and occasion.</li>
    <li>Generates AI-curated gift recommendations sourced from Shopify merchants.</li>
    <li>Provides links to Shop merchants where the recommended products can be purchased.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Eligibility & Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the Mini only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You may not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Misrepresent the information you submit to the questionnaire.</li>
    <li>Attempt to probe or disrupt our infrastructure or the Shop platform.</li>
    <li>Upload, transmit, or otherwise make available any content that is unlawful, harmful, or infringing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. AI-Generated Content</h2>
  <p>Gift recommendations are generated by AI systems. While we strive for accuracy and personalization, AI outputs may contain errors or biases. You acknowledge that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recommendations are informational and should not be considered endorsements.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for verifying product details, availability, and suitability before purchasing.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for inaccuracies or omissions in AI-generated content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Product Purchases</h2>
  <p>All purchases occur through Shopify merchants. We do not handle payment processing or shipping. Any transaction you complete is subject to the merchant's own terms, policies, and privacy practices.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Gift Finder, including its UI, branding, and original content, is owned by Argo Apps. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse engineer any portion of the Mini without written permission.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Mini relies on third-party services, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shopify Shop App:</strong> Gift Finder runs exclusively inside the Shop app.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Providers:</strong> Anthropic Claude or other approved AI models generate recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Shopify Merchants:</strong> Products are sold by independent merchants.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each third-party service may have its own terms and privacy notices. Your use of those services is governed by their respective agreements.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>THE MINI IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Argo Apps and its officers, employees, and partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of the Mini. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid to use the Mini (which is currently $0).</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to the Service</h2>
  <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Mini at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms periodically. Continued use of the Mini after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the Mini at our sole discretion, including if we believe you have violated these Terms or the Shop platform policies.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by applicable laws in the jurisdiction where Argo Apps operates. Any disputes shall be resolved in the competent courts of that jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these Terms or the Mini, contact us at <a href="mailto:argowebapps@gmail.com">argowebapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>
